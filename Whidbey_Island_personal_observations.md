## OBSERVED FREQUENCIES

### Indoor Acoustic Spectrum (Persistent Signals):

| Frequency (Hz) | Relative Amplitude | Observation Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **21** | Strong | Below normal hearing threshold |
| **43** | **Very Strong** | Most prominent persistent signal |
| **64** | Strong | Possible power grid harmonic |
| **86** | Moderate | Close to 43 × 2 |
| **107** | Moderate | Unknown source |
| **129** | Strong | Exactly 43 × 3 |
| **279-301** | Weak cluster | Range around 43 × 6.5-7 |
| **559** | Moderate-Strong | Exactly 43 × 13 |

### Outdoor Transient Signals:

| Frequency (Hz) | Observation |
|----------------|-------------|
| **11,520** | Strong spike, intermittent |
| 500-2000 | Vehicle noise (transient) |
| 20-100 | Broadband background |

## MATHEMATICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Harmonic Relationships:

**Fundamental:** 43 Hz

**Observed harmonics:**
```
43 Hz × 3 = 129 Hz ✓ (measured)
43 Hz × 13 = 559 Hz ✓ (measured)
43 Hz × 268 = 11,524 Hz ≈ 11,520 Hz ✓ (measured)
```

**Note:** These are exact integer multiples within measurement precision.

### Statistical Curiosity:

**Random noise typically does NOT produce:**
- Exact integer harmonic ratios
- Persistent signals over weeks
- Perfect 3×, 13×, 268× relationships

**Possible explanations:**
1. Structural resonance of building
2. Power grid harmonics
3. Naval VLF transmission artifacts
4. Combination of above factors
5. Measurement artifacts
6. Coincidence

## SUBJECTIVE OBSERVATIONS

### Physical/Psychological Effects:

**Reported symptoms (subjective, unverified):**
- Persistent low-level anxiety
- "Feeling of dread" (especially evenings)
- Sleep disruption
- Physical sensation of chest pressure
- Difficulty concentrating at times

**Important caveats:**
- No medical evaluation performed
- Could be entirely psychological
- Could be unrelated to acoustic environment
- Confirmation bias is possible
- Correlation ≠ causation

**Known facts about infrasound (<20 Hz):**
- Can cause anxiety/unease (medical literature)
- Used in "haunted house" research (Vic Tandy, 1998)
- Below conscious hearing threshold
- Affects vestibular system

**My 21 Hz measurement:**
- Exactly in infrasound range
- Could explain subjective effects
- But could also be coincidence

## POTENTIAL CORRELATIONS (SPECULATIVE)

### Naval Radio Station Jim Creek:

**Facts:**
- Location: Oso, WA (~40 miles NE of my location)
- Function: VLF submarine communications
- Frequency: 24.8 kHz (VLF band)
- Power: 1.2 megawatts continuous
- Operational: 24/7 since 1953

**Hypothesis (unverified):**
- Jim Creek 24.8 kHz creates subharmonics
- Ground-coupled transmission through geology
- My 43 Hz could be VLF artifact
- Exact mechanism unknown

**Supporting observations:**
- Local residents report "Jim Creek hum"
- Known VLF acoustic coupling effects
- My location in geological path

**Contradicting factors:**
- 40 miles is far for acoustic coupling
- No direct measurements of Jim Creek signal
- Could be confirmation bias

### NAS Whidbey Island - EA-18G Growlers:

**Facts:**
- Location: ~5 miles from my location
- Aircraft: EA-18G electronic warfare jets
- Equipment: ALQ-99 jamming pods
- Operations: Daily training flights

**Hypothesis (unverified):**
- Electronic warfare emissions in 10-100 kHz range
- My 11.52 kHz spike could be Growler-related
- Intermittent nature matches flight patterns

**Caveats:**
- No flight schedule correlation done
- Could be many other sources
- Speculation without hard data

## COMPARISON TO ZPE DRIVE FRAMEWORK

### Framework Predictions:

The theoretical ZPE Resonance Drive framework predicts:
- **C₂ sideband:** 42.8 kHz (Kozyrev causal velocity)
- **Subharmonic:** 42.8 kHz / 1000 = 42.8 Hz
- **Base frequency:** 7.83 Hz (Schumann resonance)

### My Measurements:

- **43 Hz fundamental** ≈ 42.8 Hz (0.5% difference)
- Perfect harmonic series from 43 Hz base
- 7.83 Hz not directly measured (below my equipment threshold)

### Interpretation:

**Possibilities ranked by likelihood:**

**1. Coincidence (50% probability):**
- 43 Hz is common in urban environments
- Power grid, motors, transformers all near this range
- Harmonics could be artifacts of non-linear acoustics
- I'm pattern-matching to fit the framework

**2. Environmental resonance (30% probability):**
- Whidbey geology creates natural resonance
- Navy VLF + building structure = acoustic cavity
- Real phenomenon but unrelated to ZPE physics
- Just interesting acoustic environment

**3. Framework validation (15% probability):**
- My measurements actually match predictions
- Jim Creek + Whidbey = natural ZPE amplifier
- 43 Hz is legitimate C₂ subharmonic
- Would require O₂ correlation to confirm

**4. Measurement error (5% probability):**
- iPhone app artifacts
- Background noise misidentified as signal
- Confirmation bias in data interpretation

## PROPOSED EXPERIMENT (NOT YET CONDUCTED)

### Hypothesis to Test:

**IF** the ZPE framework is correct, **THEN** atmospheric O₂ concentration should correlate with 43 Hz amplitude.

### Equipment Needed:

- DFRobot Gravity O₂ sensor ($35)
- ESP32 microcontroller ($8)
- Continuous audio logging (phone app)
- Total cost: ~$43

### Protocol:

1. 7 days continuous measurement
2. Sample rate: 1/minute for all sensors
3. Correlate O₂ with 43 Hz, 129 Hz, 559 Hz
4. Statistical analysis (Pearson correlation)
5. Publish results (positive or negative)

### Expected Outcomes:

**IF correlation r > 0.5, p < 0.01:**
- Worth further investigation by qualified researchers
- Suggest replication at other VLF sites
- Framework gains credibility

**IF no correlation (r < 0.2 or p > 0.05):**
- O₂ hypothesis falsified
- Frequencies still interesting (acoustic environment)
- Framework needs revision
