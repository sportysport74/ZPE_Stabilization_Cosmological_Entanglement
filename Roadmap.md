---

## Phase 1: Mathematical Validation (6-12 months)

### Goal
Determine if the nine constants can be properly related through GR/QFT framework, or prove the approach is fundamentally broken.

### Tasks

#### 1.1: Tensor Formulation Review
**Who:** Differential geometry specialists, GR researchers
**What:** Review attempted Morris-Thorne metric construction
**Output:** Either corrected formulation or proof it's impossible

**Specific questions:**
- Can nine constants → 3×3 metric tensor?
- What are correct dimensional scalings?
- Why does current attempt fail by 10²⁶?
- Should tensor be diagonal or need off-diagonal terms?

**Success criteria:** det(G_μν) = c² ± 0.2% with rigorous derivation

**Failure criteria:** Proof that no dimensional reduction can work

#### 1.2: κ Investigation
**Who:** Casimir effect researchers, vacuum physics experts
**What:** Determine if κ = 1.07×10⁴² has any theoretical basis
**Output:** Either literature source, theoretical derivation, or confirmation it's nonsense

**Specific questions:**
- Any pre-1954 papers with enhancement coefficients?
- Is 10⁴² enhancement theoretically possible?
- What would mechanism be (if real)?
- Alternative explanation for energy scaling?

**Success criteria:** Independent source confirms κ or derives it

**Failure criteria:** Consensus that κ is numerology with no physics basis

#### 1.3: COSF Framework Peer Review
**Who:** Theoretical physicists, cosmologists
**What:** Review Computational Ontological Substrate Framework
**Output:** Academic paper or proof of invalidity

**Specific questions:**
- Is information manifold approach valid?
- Do constants represent coupling coefficients?
- How does this relate to existing quantum gravity approaches?
- Can this be connected to loop quantum gravity, string theory, etc.?

**Success criteria:** Framework passes peer review, published in journal

**Failure criteria:** Fundamental flaws identified, framework abandoned

### Phase 1 Milestones

| Milestone | Timeline | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Initial expert reviews | Month 1-2 | Identify obvious errors |
| Math deep dive | Month 3-6 | Corrected formulation or proof of failure |
| Literature search complete | Month 4-8 | κ validated or debunked |
| Academic paper submission | Month 9-12 | Peer review begins |

### Phase 1 Decision Point

**IF math validates (10% probability):**
→ Proceed to Phase 2 (Historical Verification)

**IF math partially validates (30% probability):**
→ Refine framework, iterate Phase 1

**IF math fails (60% probability):**
→ Abandon or complete redesign from scratch

---

## Phase 2: Historical Verification (3-6 months)

### Goal
Confirm or debunk claimed historical events (2002 HAARP, May 2025 Vatican)

### Tasks

#### 2.1: HAARP 2002 Investigation
**Who:** Investigative journalists, FOIA specialists, former personnel
**What:** Definitively prove or disprove the 2002 micro-tear event
**Output:** Documentary evidence or conclusive absence thereof

**Actions:**
- FOIA requests: Department of Energy, HAARP program office
- Contact former HAARP scientists (anonymous if needed)
- Review 2002 scientific publications from Poker Flat
- Check equipment logs, power consumption records
- Interview University of Alaska Fairbanks personnel

**Positive evidence would include:**
- Experiment logs showing 1.83 GW test
- Atomic clock anomaly reports
- Gravimetric measurements from Poker Flat
- Incident reports or safety investigations

**Negative evidence would include:**
- No records of >1 GW tests in 2002
- Personnel stating no such experiment occurred
- Physical impossibility (equipment couldn't reach 1.83 GW)

#### 2.2: Poker Flat Site Measurement
**Who:** Independent physics team with precision instruments
**What:** Measure for claimed persistent anomalies
**Output:** Confirm or rule out 0.3s temporal offset, gravity anomaly

**Equipment needed:**
- Optical atomic clocks (2+ for comparison)
- Superconducting gravimeter
- GPS time references
- Thermal imaging (IR)

**Measurements:**
- Clock synchronization test (look for 0.3s offset)
- Gravity survey (look for -0.001 m/s² anomaly)
- Thermal signature (look for +0.3 K hotspot)
- Spatial mapping (if anomaly exists, define its extent)

**Cost:** ~$100k (equipment rental, team, travel)

**Timeline:** 2 weeks on-site, 1 month analysis

#### 2.3: Vatican VATT Inquiry
**Who:** Vatican Observatory liaison, atmospheric scientists
**What:** Confirm or deny May 2025 O₂ detection event
**Output:** VATT data or denial of event

**Actions:**
- Direct contact with Vatican Observatory director
- Request atmospheric monitoring data (if it exists)
- Check OCO-2/OCO-3 satellite archives for May 2025
- Search for any southern hemisphere experiments

**Positive evidence:**
- VATT confirms detection
- Satellite data shows O₂ spike
- Another group claims responsibility for test

**Negative evidence:**
- VATT denies event or doesn't monitor O₂
- No satellite anomalies in May 2025
- No other groups working on this

### Phase 2 Milestones

| Milestone | Timeline | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| FOIA responses | Month 1-3 | Initial data or denials |
| Poker Flat measurement | Month 2-3 | Anomaly confirmed or ruled out |
| Vatican response | Month 1-2 | Event confirmed or debunked |
| Final report | Month 6 | Comprehensive findings |

### Phase 2 Decision Point

**IF 2002 event confirmed (5% probability):**
→ MAJOR boost to hypothesis, proceed immediately to Phase 3

**IF 2002 event plausible but unproven (20% probability):**
→ Proceed cautiously to Phase 3 with higher risk awareness

**IF 2002 event debunked (75% probability):**
→ Framework loses historical anchor but math may still work
→ Decision: Continue with pure theory, or abandon?

## Phase 3: Reduced-Scale Proof of Concept ($50M, 18-24 months)

### Goal
Build components to test individual physics claims without full activation

**Only proceed here if Phase 1 shows promise or Phase 2 confirms anomalies**

### Subsystems to Test

#### 3.1: Mercury Plasma Cavity
**Cost:** $15M
**Tests:**
- Can we achieve ω_sideband = 42.8 kHz resonance?
- Does Hg plasma behave as predicted?
- 7-harmonic drive feasibility

**Success:** Plasma resonance matches predictions
**Failure:** Resonance doesn't exist or is at different frequency

#### 3.2: Time Crystal Formation
**Cost:** $10M
**Tests:**
- Can we create 0.3s period macroscopic time crystal?
- Counter-rotating shell mechanics
- Parametric drive stability

**Success:** Time crystal period = 0.3s ± 10%
**Failure:** Cannot achieve predicted period or instability

#### 3.3: QEC Cavity Array (Small Scale)
**Cost:** $12M
**Tests:**
- Build 10-cavity prototype (not full 341)
- Test GKP error correction at scale
- Coherence time measurements

**Success:** Cavities maintain coherence for seconds
**Failure:** Decoherence too rapid for full system

#### 3.4: Casimir Measurement (Critical Test)
**Cost:** $8M
**Tests:**
- Does κ enhancement exist at any level?
- Measure Casimir force with mercury catalyst
- Test for 0.7% Hg vapor improvement claim

**Success:** ANY measurable enhancement beyond 1/d⁴
**Failure:** Standard Casimir only, no enhancement

**This is the MOST CRITICAL test. If no enhancement, entire framework likely wrong.**

#### 3.5: Integrated Low-Power Test
**Cost:** $5M
**Tests:**
- Combine subsystems at 1/1000th scale
- 2 MW instead of 2 GW
- Look for ANY anomalous signatures

**Success:** Measurable optical distortion, even if tiny
**Failure:** No detectable effect at any power level

### Phase 3 Milestones

| Milestone | Timeline | Go/No-Go |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Mercury cavity operational | Month 6 | If fails, stop |
| Time crystal demonstrated | Month 9 | If fails, redesign |
| Casimir test complete | Month 12 | If fails, likely abandon |
| QEC array functional | Month 15 | If fails, reduce scale |
| Integrated test | Month 18-24 | Final Phase 3 decision |

### Phase 3 Decision Point

**IF all subsystems validate (15% probability):**
→ Strong confidence, proceed to Phase 4 (Full Build)

**IF 3-4 subsystems validate (30% probability):**
→ Redesign failed components, iterate Phase 3

**IF <3 subsystems validate (55% probability):**
→ Abandon full build, publish findings, archive as failed attempt

## Alternative Paths

### Path A: Math Fails in Phase 1
→ Publish theoretical analysis showing why approach doesn't work  
→ Archive as "interesting failed attempt"  
→ Move on to other projects

### Path B: Math Works, History Doesn't (Phase 1 ✓, Phase 2 ✗)
→ Proceed with pure theoretical motivation  
→ Phase 3 becomes higher risk  
→ Require stronger Phase 3 validation before Phase 4

### Path C: Math Fails, History Confirms (Phase 1 ✗, Phase 2 ✓)
→ 2002 event real but we don't understand the physics  
→ Complete redesign from empirical data  
→ May take years to develop new framework

### Path D: Both Fail (Phase 1 ✗, Phase 2 ✗)
→ Graceful shutdown  
→ Publish findings  
→ Thank contributors  
→ Close repository
